                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Device-independent quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI-QSDC) enhances quantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without depending on the trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks associated with compromised or untrusted devices, which are common in traditional quantum communication.</p>
                    <p>In this paper, we propose a novel DI-QSDC protocol, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to incorporate user identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next, we implement the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware and evaluate its performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any eavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol's robust security and practical feasibility for real-world quantum communication.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>We propose to develop quantum true random number generation (QTRNG) in IBM's quantum laboratory by implementing the Random Quantum Fourier Transform (RQFT) technique utilizing quantum gates. This approach overcomes the imperfections caused by noise and decoherence in quantum circuits by utilizing the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to replace the computational basis with a Fourier basis comprising a complex superposition of qubit states. For usage in symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic applications, the RQFT-based QTRNG produces unpredictable high quality random numbers. It satisfies all the preliminary tests, Autocorrelation test, and extensive National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suites, such as SP 800-90 and SP 800-22 are used to assess the generated sequences randomness in order to guarantee their robustness and reliability.</p>

                    <p>Approximate quantum error correction for non-Markovian noise process</p>
                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>We prove the sufficiency of approximate quantum error correction for non-Markovian noise, with a focus on noise-adapted techniques tailored to non-Markovian amplitude damping noise. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian Petz channel can be precisely constructed to adapt to non-Markovian amplitude damping. However, implementing such a map poses practical challenges. Through numerical simulations, we show that both Markovian and non-Markovian Petz channels can correct non-Markovian errors with high fidelity. We illustrate our results using both stabilizer and non-stabilizer non-degenerate codes. Our work suggests that most existing methods, including standard and approximate (channel-adapted) quantum error correction, are ineffective against quantum non-Markovian noise. In contrast, channel-adapted methods are successful when the Petz channel is used as a universal, near-optimal recovery.</p>

                    <p>Unbounded Sharing of Nonlocality Using Qubit Projective Measurements</p>
                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>It is  a common perception that a sharp projective measurement in one side of the Bell experiment destroys the entanglement of the shared state, thereby preventing the demonstration of sequential sharing of nonlocality. In contrast, we introduce a local randomness-assisted projective measurement protocol, enabling the sharing of nonlocality by an arbitrary number of sequential observers (Bobs) with a single spatially separated party Alice. Subsequently, a crucial feature of the interplay between the degrees of incompatibility of observables of both parties is revealed, enabling the unbounded sharing of nonlocality. Our findings, not only offer a new paradigm for understanding the fundamental nature of incompatibility in demonstrating quantum nonlocality but also pave a new path for various information processing tasks based on local randomness-assisted projective measurement.

                    <p>Modular Quantum Many-Body Sensors</p>
                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Quantum many-body systems undergoing phase transitions have been proposed as probes enabling beyond-classical enhancement of sensing precision. However, this enhancement is usually limited to a very narrow region around the critical point. Here, we systematically develop a modular approach for introducing multiple phase transitions in a many-body system. This naturally allows us to enlarge the region of quantum-enhanced precision by encompassing the newly created phase boundaries. Our approach is general and can be applied to both symmetry-breaking and topological quantum sensors. In symmetry-breaking sensors, we show that the newly created critical points inherit the original universality class and a simple total magnetization measurement already suffices to locate them. In topological sensors, our modular construction creates multiple bands which leads to a rich phase diagram. In both cases, Heisenberg scaling for Hamiltonian parameter estimation is achieved at all the phase boundaries. This can be exploited to create a global sensor which significantly outperforms a uniform probe.  </p>

                    <p>Quantum-enhanced sensing via Stark localization transition</p>
                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Gradient fields can effectively suppress particle tunneling and localize the wave function at all energy scales, a phenomenon known as Stark localization. Here, we show that Stark systems can be used as a probe for the precise measurement of gradient fields, particularly in the weak-field regime where most sensors do not operate optimally. In the extended phase, Stark probes achieve super-Heisenberg precision, which is well beyond most of the known quantum sensing schemes. In the localized phase, the precision drops in a universal way showing fast convergence to the thermodynamic limit. For single-particle probes, we show that quantum-enhanced sensitivity, with super-Heisenberg precision, can be achieved through a simple position measurement for all the eigenstates across the entire spectrum. For such probes, we have identified several critical exponents of the Stark localization transition and established their relationship. Thermal fluctuations, whose universal behavior is identified, reduce the precision from super-Heisenberg to Heisenberg, still outperforming classical sensors. Multiparticle interacting probes also achieve super-Heisenberg scaling in their extended phase, which shows even further enhancement near the transition point. Quantum-enhanced sensitivity is still achievable even when long-range interactions are taken into consideration.</p>

                    <p>Quantum image encryption algorithm based on 3D-BNM chaotic map</p>
                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>This study presents a novel quantum image encryption algorithm, using a 3D chaotic map and controlled qubit-level scrambling operations. The newly proposed 3D-BNM chaotic map effectively reduces the degradation of chaotic dynamics resulting from the finite word length effect. It facilitates the generation of highly unpredictable random sequences and enhances chaotic performance. The systemâ€™s efficacy is additionally enhanced by the inclusion of a SHA-256 hash function. Initially, classical plain images are converted into their quantum equivalents using the Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) model. The Generalized Quantum Arnold Transformation (GQAT) is then applied to disrupt the coordinate information of the quantum image. Subsequently, to diffuse the pixel values of the scrambled image, XOR operations are performed using pseudorandom sequences generated by the 3D-BNM chaotic map. Furthermore, to enhance the randomness and reduce the correlation among the pixels in the resulting cipher image, a controlled qubit-level scrambling operation is employed. The encryption process utilizes fundamental quantum gates such as C-NOT and CCNOT. Both theoretical and numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against various statistical and differential attacks. Moreover, the proposed encryption algorithm operates with low computational complexity.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Supersymmetry (SUSY), a concept originally formulated in quantum field theories, can also be studied in certain quantum mechanical models. A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes these SUSY models by probing for the zero energy modes and SUSY breaking. In its original formulation, the Witten index is a mathematical object not connected to any physical observable. In this talk, I shall discuss a modified form, the normalized Witten index that we propose in our work, constructed by averaging over a distribution so that it is a physical observable. We discuss this proposal in the context of the supersymmetric XXZ model, which is one of the rare many-body systems with exact SUSY and show this model can be realized with Rydberg atoms in tweezers. In addition, we discuss the robustness of this observable against the SUSY breaking perturbations at low temperatures, which follows from the topological zero energy modes.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>We address the influence of magnetic fields with varying shapes and characters on the dynamics of open quantum systems. A configuration comprising magnetic pulses, thermal effects, gravity, and a non-locally correlated channel is studied. In a quantum magnetic system, we demonstrate how exponential and periodic magnetic pulses promote the formation of quantum and classical ridges against different ground and excited state energies. In particular, the detailed feasibility of the joint application of exponential and periodic magnetic pulses with correlated channels for the dynamics of quantum features and the associated experimental design for our studied theoretical model is elaborated. Finally, we find that the periodic magnetic functions are more powerful to induce non- Markovianity compared to the quantum channels, while the Markovian ones generate more stable and higher-entangled states. For the periodic magnetic fields, strong quantum entanglement ridges are witnessed against the very low ground and excited state amplitudes in the system.</p>

                    <p>Computationally efficient method to characterize Noncontextual behaviour </p>
                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Finding a set of empirical criteria fulfilled by any theory that satisfies the generalized notion of
                        noncontextuality is a challenging task of both operational and foundational importance. The conventional approach of deriving facet inequalities from the relevant noncontextual polytope is computationally demanding. Specifically, the noncontextual polytope is a product of two polytopes, one for
                            preparations and the other for measurements, and the dimension of the former typically increases
                            polynomially with the number of measurements. This work presents an alternative methodology for
                            constructing a polytope that encompasses the actual noncontextual polytope while ensuring that the
                            dimension of the polytope associated with the preparations remains constant regardless of the number of measurements and their outcome size. In particular, the facet inequalities of this polytope serve
                        as necessary conditions for noncontextuality. To demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, we apply it to nine distinct contextuality scenarios involving four to nine preparations and two to three
                    measurements to obtain the respective sets of facet inequalities. Additionally, we retrieve the maximum quantum violations of these inequalities. Our investigation uncovers many novel non-trivial
                    noncontextuality inequalities and reveals intriguing aspects and applications of quantum contextual correlations.</p>
